## 👩🏻‍💻 About Me

Hello! 👋 I'm originally from South Korea 🇰🇷 and currently a student at 42 Heilbronn 🎓. I'm also pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science from Korean National Open University 📚.

After working for over 4 years as an IT Project Consultant in Paris 🇫🇷, I am now deepening my technical skills to further advance in my career.

My GitHub repositories mainly showcase projects I've worked on as part of the 42 Core Curriculum, with a focus on C/C++ programming, systems programming, and algorithm development 💻.

I am passionate about software development and IT project management 💡, aiming to combine my previous project management experience with my growing technical expertise.

Feel free to explore my projects 🌟 and reach out if you'd like to collaborate! 🤝
